names.txt: list of names for 1000g format chromosomes, for sorting with bedtools

whole_genome_1000g.bed: this file simply describes the regions covering the whole
genome from chroms 1-22, X and Y. It will be used as a dummy
bed file when simulated read data is assessed for precision and recall and
we actually just want to use the simulated variants across the whole genome
instead of certain "confidently known" regions.
