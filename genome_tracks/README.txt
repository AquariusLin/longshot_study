segmental_duplications_0.99_similar_hg19.bed:This file was generated by accessing
UCSC Table Browser at https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables
and selecting: Mammal, Human, hg19, Repeats, Segmental Dups, genomicSuperDups,
genome, and then adding filter fracMatch >= 0.99,
output format: BED, then get output, then get BED

segmental_duplications_0.99_similar_1000g.bed: This file was modified from
"segmental_duplications_0.99_similar_hg19.bed" into 1000 Genomes format by
removing all the "chr" from the chromosome names and removing regions not in 1-22, X, or Y,
and sorting with bedtools sort.

whole_genome_1000g.bed: this file simply describes the regions covering the whole
genome from chroms 1-22, X and Y. It will be used as a dummy
bed file when simulated read data is assessed for precision and recall and
we actually just want to use the simulated variants across the whole genome
instead of certain "confidently known" regions.

STRs_hg19.bed: This file was generated by accessing UCSC Table Browser and selecting:
Mammal, Human, hg19, Repeats, microsatellites,
genome, output format: BED.

STRs_1000g.bed: This file was modified from
"STRs_hg19.bed" into 1000 Genomes format by
removing all the "chr" from the chromosome names and removing regions not in 1-22, X, or Y,
and sorting with bedtools sort.
